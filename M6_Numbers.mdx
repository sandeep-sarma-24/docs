## Lesson 2: Importing a number from Twilio

### What Does Importing Mean?

If you already own purchased phone numbers from Twilio, you can seamlessly import them into the Inya platform. This saves time and allows you to use your existing numbers for both testing and production calls.

### Why Import Your Twilio Numbers?

* **Efficiency:** Reuse your existing numbers without the hassle of buying new ones.

* **Central Management:** View all your active numbers in one place.

* **Enhanced Functionality:** Easily assign numbers to agents for inbound or outbound calls.

### How to Import a Twilio Number

1. **Access Active Numbers:**

   * Click on the **Phone Numbers** option in the sidebar.

   * Expand the section to show **Active Numbers**.

2. **Initiate the Import Process:**

   * If no numbers have been imported, you’ll see an option to **Import.**

   * If numbers are already present, the **Import** button will be available in the top right.

3. **Enter Your Credentials:**

   * You’ll be prompted to enter your Twilio **Account SID** and **Auth Token**.

   * The system validates these credentials.

   * If incorrect, an error message will prompt you to re-enter the correct details.

4. **Select and Import Numbers:**

   * Upon successful validation, a paginated table will display available Twilio numbers (excluding previously imported ones).

   * You can select one or multiple numbers (using checkboxes and a “Select All” option).

   * Confirm your selection, optionally add labels, and complete the import

*Best Practice:* Double-check the list before confirming. If any number fails to import due to duplicates or API issues, the system will notify you of the ones needing attention.
