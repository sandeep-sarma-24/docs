## **Introduction & Context**

Variables and actions power automation in your genAI agent. **Variables** allow dynamic data handling, while **actions** trigger workflows based on user interactions.

***

## **Lesson 1: Understanding Variables**

### **What Are Variables?**

Variables act as placeholders for storing and managing data throughout a conversation. They can:

* **Capture user input** (e.g., name, phone number, order details).

* **Store API responses** (e.g., retrieving order status). *(Coming Soon)*

* **Pass data into API requests** (e.g., including an ID for fetching details).

### **How to Create a Variable?**

1. **Define a Name** â€“ Use letters, numbers, or underscores (e.g., `user_name`, `order_id`).

2. **Choose a Data Type**:

   * **Boolean** (True/False)

   * **Integer** (Whole numbers)

   * **Float** (Decimal numbers)

   * **String** (Text, such as names or messages)

3. **Set a Prompt** â€“ Define how the variable gets its value.

   * Example: "Ask the user for their PIN code (must be 6 digits)."

### **When to Use Variables?**

* **On-Call Triggering:**

  * **Before an API Call** â€“ Store user input to pass into an API request.

  * **After an API Call** â€“ Save data received from an API response. *(Clarification needed: What happens if the data isnâ€™t stored?)*

* **Post-Call Triggering:** Use the variable to execute actions after a conversation.

### **Use Cases**

Personalizing emails, customizing SMS messages, or logging details in CRM systems.

## **Lesson 2: Setting Up Actions**

### **What Are Actions?**

Actions define **triggers** that send automated responses or execute integrations based on specific conditions.

### **How to Create an Action?**

1. Go to **Manage Agents â†’ Select Agent â†’ Action Tab**.

2. Click the **"+"** button to open the "**Create Action**" card.

3. **Enter a Name** - Use only letters, numbers, or underscores.

4. **Describe the Action** â€“ Example: "Trigger this action when the user asks about available offers."

5. **Select an Integration** â€“ Choose the service to execute the action.

6. **Choose a Trigger:**

   * **Post-Call** â€“ Executes after the conversation ends.

   * **On-Call** â€“ Executes during the conversation.

7. **Create or Add Variables (Optional):**

   * Use variables to store dynamic data like customer names or order details.

   * You can create new variables or reuse existing ones.

### **Integration-Specific Fields**

The fields below depend on the type of integration used.

### **For SMS Action:**

* **Message Template:** Define the SMS content. Insert variables using curly braces:

  * Example: `"Hello {{user_name}}, your order {{order_id}} is on the way!"`

### For Email Action:

* **Select Action:** *(Work in Progress)*

* **Template Name:** Select an email template from Mailchimp.

* **From Name & Email:** The senderâ€™s verified email address in Mailchimp.

* **To Name & Email:** The recipient's email (variable input is recommended).

* **Add Subject:** Customizable subject line (can include variables).

* **Merge Variables:** Map platform variables to Mailchimp template variables:

  * **Key:** Variable in Mailchimp template.

  * **Value:** Corresponding variable created in Inya (use curly braces).

***

### For CRM Action:

* **Select Action:** Choose a CRM action (e.g., CREATE for adding new records). *(Work in Progress)*

* **Module Name:** Specify the CRM module (e.g., Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Deals).

* **Payload:** Define JSON data format:\{  "Company": "Example Corp",  "name": "Smith",  "Email": "john.smith@example.com"}

### For Ticket Action:

* **Select Action:** Choose a ticketing action (e.g., CREATE for new support tickets). *(Work in Progress)*

* **Department ID:** Specify the Zoho Desk department where the ticket should be created.

* **Contact ID:** Associate the ticket with a customer profile. Currently this is for testing the capabilities of the platform, but it will be a dynamic field in the future.

* **Payload:** Define the ticket structure in JSON format. The subject, description and priority are mandatory fields to create a ticket in Zoho Desk.

\{
&#x20; "subject": "\{\{subject}}",
&#x20; "description": "\{\{description}}",
&#x20; "priority": "\{\{priority}}"
}

### For Custom API Action:

* **Method & URL:** Pre-populated based on the integration.

* Options to turn headers, params and body on and off will be available based on the API Method.

* **Headers:** Send additional information about your API request, such as authentication details or metadata:

  * Example:

    * **Key:** `Authorization`

    * **Value:** `Bearer <your-token>`

* **Params:** Params help filter or modify the request. You can add multiple key-value pairs.

  * Example: Filter by age:

    * **Key:** `age`

    * **Value:** `30`

* **Body:** The body contains the data sent to the API, which is usually in JSON format. You can add multiple key-value pairs.

  * **Key**: `name` â†’ **Value**: `Jack Reacher`

  * **Key**: `email` â†’ **Value**: [`reacher@example.com`](mailto:reacher@example.com)

* **Timeout:** Define max wait time before the request times out. The platform will wait for a response from the server for the defined time before canceling the request. If the server doesnâ€™t respond within this time, the request fails with a timeout error.

*Your genAI agent is now equipped with powerful automation tools! ðŸŽ¯*
