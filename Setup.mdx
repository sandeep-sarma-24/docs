### **Step 1: Set up the Org Chart**

- Define your organisational structure within the tool to reflect reporting lines and team hierarchies.
  - **Access the Org Chart Setup:** Navigate to the organisation settings section.
  - **Define Hierarchy:** Select and arrange roles to match your internal structure (e.g., Admin -\> Supervisor -\> QA Lead -\> QA -\> Agent).
  - **Customise Roles:** Use the drag-and-drop interface to position roles. You can also delete roles that do not apply to your organisation.

### **Step 2: Access Roles and Permissions**

- Understand the permissions assigned to each role to ensure proper access control.
  - **View Permissions:** Go to the roles management section to see the default permissions (e.g., Create, View, Edit, Delete) associated with each role.
  - **Request Modifications:** Currently, permissions are predefined. If you require custom permission sets or modifications, please contact the Aura support team, and they will assist in making the necessary adjustments.

### **Step 3: Manage Users**

Add your team members to the platform and assign them to their respective roles.

- **Navigate to User Management:** Find the section for adding and managing users.
- **Single User Upload:**
- Click on 'Add Single User'
- Enter the required details: Name, Email, Assigned Role, Reporting Role, Reporting Manager, and any other relevant information.
- Save the user profile.
- **Bulk User Upload:**
- Download the sample Excel template provided within the user management section.
- Fill the template with the details for all users you wish to add. Ensure accuracy in role assignments and reporting structures.
- Upload the completed Excel file.
- The system will process the file. Successful entries will be added automatically. Any entries with errors will be highlighted, allowing you to easily access the specific user profile and correct the information.
