- **Access Assigned QA Forms:** QA personnel can find the scorecards assigned to them for specific calls or agents within their QA queue or dashboard (potentially via the Manage QA section, Tab 1).
- **Evaluate Performance:** QA evaluators use the assigned digital scorecard to assess the agent's performance based on the defined criteria, selecting answers and adding scores.
- **Integrated Playback:** Play the call recording directly within the QA interface while filling out the scorecard for easy reference.
- **Add Notes & Tagging:** QA evaluators can add specific notes or feedback within the form. They can also tag relevant personnel (e.g., the agent, supervisor) to draw their attention to specific points, facilitating targeted coaching.
