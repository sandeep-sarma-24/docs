## Setting up

### *Welcome Aboard!*

Youâ€™re about to build a conversational GenAI agent that can talk with your customers, understand, empathize and provide solutions. Think of this platform as your agentic lab.

* **Knowledge Bases**Â = Your agentâ€™s memory.

* **Agents**Â = Your 24/7 delegates who speak with your customers.

* **Integrations**Â = Superpowers (like SMS, email, CRM).

* **Actions** = Your agentâ€™s workflows and automations.

**First Steps:**

1. **Create a Knowledge Base**Â (Feed your agent information).

2. **Build an Agent**Â (Define its role and style).

3. **Add Integrations**Â (Connect to tools like Zoho or Twilio).

4. **Add Actions** (Define how your agent uses integrations to automate tasks).

5. **Test & Launch**Â (Watch it come alive!).

The first step to world-class documentation is setting up your editing environments.
