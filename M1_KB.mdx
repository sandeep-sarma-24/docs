### **Introduction & Context**

A robust knowledge base is the foundation of your AI agent, it contains the information your agent uses to generate accurate responses. Think of it as the agentâ€™s **brain**, filled with knowledge that enables it to answer questions effectively.

*Your agentâ€™s brain needs fuel. Letâ€™s feed it!*

### **Lesson 1: Uploading a Document (PDF/DOC)**

* **What It Is:** Upload documents that contain essential information such as FAQs, manuals, company policies, and SOPs to train your AI agent.

* **How It Works:**

  1. Navigate to **Knowledge Base â†’ Add Knowledge Base.**

  2. Click in the **Knowledge Base Files** section and select your PDF, DOC or DOCX file(s).

  3. You can also drag and drop your files.

  4. Click on **Next** and give you Knowledge Base a name.

  5. Click on **Start Training** to process the document.

  6. The platform analyzes the content and makes it accessible for the genAI agent to use.

* **Use Cases:** Customer FAQs, internal policy documents, product manuals.

* **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips:**

  * Use clear headings and structured formatting. Your genAI agent learns best from well-organized documents.

  * Need to update your knowledge base? Go to the **Knowledge Base** section and click on the delete or upload button

### **Lesson 2: Importing a Knowledge Base from a URL**

* **What It Is:** Extract content from a webpage to train your AI agent.

* **How It Works:**

  1. Navigate to **Agent Related â†’ Knowledge Base â†’ Add Knowledge Base.**

  2. Click on **Add a URL.**

  3. Paste a valid website URL and click on **Next.**

  4. The platform will scrape text content from the page and follow links (up to Level 1).

  5. Select specific sub-URLs to include, then click **Next** and enter a name for your Knowledge Base.

  6. Click **Start Training.**

* **Why Use This?** Perfect for leveraging online help centers, publicly available documents, or product pages without manually copying content.

* **Use Cases:** Company blogs, support portals, product pages, pricing pages.

* **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips:**
